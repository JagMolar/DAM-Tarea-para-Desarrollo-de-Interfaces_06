    <h1>4 Authoring Help Information</h1>
    <p>
        The topics in this chapter of the JavaHelp System User's Guide describe the aspects of the JavaHelp
        software that are of primary interest to online help authors. These topics assume that the author is responsible
        for creating the metadata files that the JavaHelp software uses to present information, as well as the topics
        that inform the application's users. Together the metadata and topic files are referred to as a helpset.

        If you use a help authoring tool to create your help system, some of the details described in this
        chapter are managed for you by the tool.
